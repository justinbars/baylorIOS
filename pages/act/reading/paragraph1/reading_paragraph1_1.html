<div class="readingText">People often ask me, how does one get a Nobel prize? And what is the secret of success? And incidentally, the same people had no interest in asking this question before I received the prize. I believe it was passion for science that supplied the energy, and it was optimism that made the almost impossible, possible. My dear graduates, success comes to the prepared mind. Success is not like rain that falls from the sky equally upon everyone. Success is what you reap when you sow with passion and optimism.</div>
