(I’ll provide all questions with answers for the APP separately).  If this is the 1st question, once an answer is chosen the 2nd question appears in the next screen.  Once both questions are answered, a video immediately appears explaining GR #1.  At the end of the video I’ll ask them to review their answers. The same 1st and second questions will appear again without their answers selected.  Once they’ve chosen again.  A video automatically appears: of me explaining answers.
Then the next screen that automatically appears we’ll call screen 7.
